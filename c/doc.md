# C programming

You can explore headers in /usr/include

```
ls /usr/include
ls /usr/include/stdio.h
ls /usr/include/string.h
ls /usr/include/linux # kernel header files
ls /usr/include/asm # kernel header files
```

You can open a header file to see its prototypes
```
less /usr/include/stdio.h
```

Make use of the man command for C functions. 
```
man 3 printf # 3 is for C functions
man 3 fopen
man 3 malloc
```
